<p><em><strong>I like to eat, dance, sing , do nails and hair. My favorite show is Dancing Dolls and The Amazing World of Gum Ball. I'm 16 years old , and my birthday is July 30th. When I graduate high school I plan on attending a 2 or 4 year college to major in business. One day </strong></em><em><strong>I will own my own Hair Salon and make a lot of money. I like getting my hair and nails done , I have my own style that keeps people guessing. Maybe I'll dress like a girl one day and a boy the next. I'm different!  People don't understand me at all , they just look at me and judge me because I wear nice things. Everybody has a story and I'd rather keep mine to myself. I'm Jabre my name means I'm Powerful, Honest, Brilliant, Courageous, Determined, and Original. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I eat a lot , like ALL THE TIME! It's more like a habit. My favorite foods are macaroni and cheese, shrimp, and tacos. My favorite candy is airheads and mambas. I dance and sing only when I'm bored and have nothing else to do. Those </strong></em><em><strong>are my hobbies. I take a nail tech class here at school , I will be finishing that class next year and on the road to get my nail tech license.</strong></em></p>

<p>One day I will be rich with alot of income! I will have 3 salons In different states and a dance studio. My goal is to explain my business. With the help of friends, family and god, I will be successful. I want to explore the world, my first stop is Paris, then Puerto Rico. I hate planes but maybe I will take the chance of flying in one just to get to where I want to go.</p>

<p style="font-size: large; color: #000000; text-align: left;">I'm learning how to do acrylic nails in nail tech. I LOVE acrylic nails more than polishing nails because they last longer and you can get different designs and colors.</p>

<p>Honey 4 is my favorite dance movie. It's a hip-hop movie about a girl coming out her shell doing everything that loves and proving the people that doubted her wrong! Especially her Mother.</p>
